Once up on a time, There was no snow and so-called chill weather here in Madison, Wisconsin. People love to enjoy the warmth suni.

However, after hundreds of years, people in Wisconsin started getting tired of the gentle climate. Therefore, they decided to pray for cooler weather every day. Surprisingly, their dream came true.

So... now we are suffering from endless freezing cold wheather and snow. People is starting praying for warming again.. but we all know it would be a problem since we are facing global warming.

Hundreds of years later, the weather got so called, that there was a polar vortex. It was so cold that UW Madison cancelled classes for two days.

Students are sooooo happy about these two days off. They keep praying and praying. Wish for more days off. Eventually, all of their dream come true. Madison is getting colder and colder and we have more and more school days off in the coming future.
